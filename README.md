## Current Articles

### <a href='https://www.thingsmadesimple.com/2022/11/28/ym3812-part-1-register-basics/'>YM3812 Part 1: Register Basics</a>
Focuses on FM Synthesis basics, the YM3812's register map and electrically controlling the chip's pins.

### <a href='https://thingsmadesimple.com/2023/01/02/ym3812-part-2-face-reveal/'>YM3812 Part 2: FACE Reveal</a>
Introduces a basic implementation of the YM3812 circuit controlled by an AVR128DA28 microcontroller that we will build on in future articles. Think of it as a "Hello World" starting point that ensure the circuit works and that we can upload code to the microcontroller.

### <a href='https://www.thingsmadesimple.com/2023/01/21/ym3812-part-3-behind-the-code/'>YM3812 Part 3: Behind the Code</a>
Walks through the implementation of the YM3812 class used in Part 2 and describes how each of the register manipulation functions work.
